# Contributing to Advanced ULID Library

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## 🚀 Development Process

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

### Pull Requests

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

## 🧪 Testing

We maintain high test coverage and all contributions should include appropriate tests.

```bash
# Run all tests
go test -v ./...

# Run tests with race detection
go test -race ./...

# Run benchmarks
go test -bench=. ./...

# Check test coverage
go test -cover ./...
```

## 📝 Code Style

We follow standard Go conventions:

- Use `gofmt` to format your code
- Use `golint` and `go vet` to catch common issues
- Follow effective Go guidelines
- Write clear, self-documenting code
- Add comments for exported functions and types

### Code Organization

- Keep functions focused and small
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Group related functionality together
- Maintain consistent error handling patterns

## 🐛 Bug Reports

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/bold-minds/id/issues/new).

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

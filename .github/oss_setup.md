# GitHub Repository Security Setup Guide

This step-by-step guide will help you configure your GitHub repository for safe public contributions with enterprise-grade security.

## 🚀 **Prerequisites**
- [ ] Repository is pushed to GitHub
- [ ] You have admin access to the repository
- [ ] Repository contains all security files (CODEOWNERS, dependabot.yml, codeql.yml, etc.)

---

## 📋 **Step-by-Step Security Configuration**

### **STEP 1: Enable Security & Analysis Features**
Navigate to: `Settings → Security & analysis`

- [ ] **Dependency graph** → Click "Enable"
- [ ] **Dependabot alerts** → Click "Enable" 
- [ ] **Dependabot security updates** → Click "Enable"
- [ ] **Dependabot version updates** → Click "Enable"
- [ ] **Code scanning alerts** → Click "Set up" → "Set up this workflow" (CodeQL)
- [ ] **Secret scanning** → Click "Enable"
- [ ] **Private vulnerability reporting** → Click "Enable"

**✅ Result:** Automated security monitoring is now active

---

### **STEP 2: Configure Branch Protection (CRITICAL)**
Navigate to: `Settings → Branches → Add rule`

**Branch name pattern:** `main`

#### **Protect matching branches:**
- [ ] ✅ **Require a pull request before merging**
  - [ ] ✅ **Required number of reviewers before merging:** `1`
  - [ ] ✅ **Dismiss stale PR approvals when new commits are pushed**
  - [ ] ✅ **Require review from code owners**

#### **Require status checks:**
- [ ] ✅ **Require status checks to pass before merging**
- [ ] ✅ **Require branches to be up to date before merging**
- [ ] **Select status checks:** Look for `test` or `validate` (your CI workflow)

#### **Additional restrictions:**
- [ ] ✅ **Require conversation resolution before merging**
- [ ] ✅ **Restrict pushes that create files larger than 100 MB**

#### **Rules applied to everyone:**
- [ ] ✅ **Restrict force pushes**
- [ ] ✅ **Do not allow bypassing the above settings**
- [ ] ✅ **Include administrators** (applies rules to you too)

**Click "Create" to save the rule**

**✅ Result:** Main branch is now protected from direct pushes

---

### **STEP 3: Configure Repository Access**
Navigate to: `Settings → Manage access`

#### **Repository visibility:**
- [ ] Ensure repository is set to **Public**

#### **Manage access:**
- [ ] **Base permissions:** Should be "Read" (default for public repos)
- [ ] **Add collaborators:** Only add trusted maintainers with "Write" or "Admin" access
- [ ] **Teams:** Configure if using GitHub organization

**✅ Result:** Access controls are properly configured

---

### **STEP 4: Configure Pull Request Settings**
Navigate to: `Settings → General → Pull Requests`

#### **Allow merge types:**
- [ ] ✅ **Allow merge commits**
- [ ] ✅ **Allow squash merging** (recommended for clean history)
- [ ] ✅ **Allow rebase merging**

#### **Pull request settings:**
- [ ] ✅ **Always suggest updating pull request branches**
- [ ] ✅ **Allow auto-merge**
- [ ] ✅ **Automatically delete head branches**

**Click "Update" to save**

**✅ Result:** PR workflow is optimized for contributions

---

### **STEP 5: Configure Repository Features**
Navigate to: `Settings → General → Features`

#### **Enable useful features:**
- [ ] ✅ **Issues** (for bug reports and feature requests)
- [ ] ✅ **Discussions** (for community Q&A)
- [ ] ✅ **Projects** (optional, for project management)
- [ ] ❌ **Wiki** (disable - use README instead)
- [ ] ✅ **Sponsorships** (optional, if you want GitHub Sponsors)

**✅ Result:** Community features are properly configured

---

### **STEP 6: Configure GitHub Actions**
Navigate to: `Settings → Actions → General`

#### **Actions permissions:**
- [ ] ✅ **Allow all actions and reusable workflows** OR
- [ ] ✅ **Allow actions created by GitHub** + **Allow actions by Marketplace verified creators**

#### **Workflow permissions:**
- [ ] ✅ **Read repository contents and packages permissions**
- [ ] ✅ **Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests**

**✅ Result:** CI/CD and Dependabot can function properly

---

### **STEP 7: Verify Security Files Are Present**
Check that these files exist in your repository:

#### **Required security files:**
- [ ] `.github/CODEOWNERS` - Ensures code review assignments
- [ ] `.github/dependabot.yml` - Automated dependency updates
- [ ] `.github/workflows/codeql.yml` - Security scanning
- [ ] `.github/workflows/test.yaml` - CI validation
- [ ] `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` - Community standards
- [ ] `SECURITY.md` - Vulnerability reporting process
- [ ] `CONTRIBUTING.md` - Contribution guidelines
- [ ] `LICENSE` - Open source license

#### **Template files:**
- [ ] `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md`
- [ ] `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature_request.md`
- [ ] `.github/pull_request_template.md`

**✅ Result:** All security and community files are in place

---

### **STEP 8: Test Your Configuration**
Perform these tests to verify everything works:

#### **Branch protection test:**
- [ ] Try to push directly to main branch (should be blocked)
- [ ] Create a test PR and verify:
  - [ ] CI runs automatically
  - [ ] Review is required before merge
  - [ ] Status checks must pass

#### **Security features test:**
- [ ] Check that Dependabot created PRs (may take 24 hours)
- [ ] Verify CodeQL analysis runs on PRs
- [ ] Test issue templates work properly

**✅ Result:** All security measures are functioning

---

## 🎯 **Final Security Checklist**

### **Critical Security Measures (Must Have):**
- [ ] ✅ Branch protection enabled on `main`
- [ ] ✅ Required PR reviews (minimum 1)
- [ ] ✅ Required status checks (CI must pass)

## 🚨 **Critical Warning Signs**

**If any of these are true, your repository is NOT secure:**
- ❌ Can push directly to main branch
- ❌ PRs can be merged without review
- ❌ CI can be bypassed
- ❌ No security scanning enabled
- ❌ Dependabot disabled

---

## 🎉 **Success!**

Once all steps are complete, your repository will have:

✅ **Enterprise-grade security** - Protected against common vulnerabilities  
✅ **Automated monitoring** - Dependabot + CodeQL scanning  
✅ **Quality gates** - CI must pass, reviews required  
✅ **Community standards** - Clear guidelines and templates  
✅ **Professional setup** - Ready for public contributions  

Your Go exception library is now **production-ready** with the same security standards used by major open source projects! 🚀

## 📞 **Need Help?**

If you encounter issues:
1. Check GitHub's documentation: https://docs.github.com
2. Verify you have admin permissions on the repository
3. Ensure all files are committed and pushed to GitHub
4. Wait 24 hours for some features (like Dependabot) to activate

**Remember:** It's better to be overly cautious with security settings than to leave vulnerabilities open!
